# Hyperledger Fabric Drug Tracking Web Application

This is a highly scalable and secure drug tracking web application that leverages the power of the Hyperledger Fabric network to create a reliable and transparent drug supply chain system. It provides a distributed workflow across three organizations, including the manufacturer, distributor, and retailer, allowing them to add medication batches and transfer ownership while restricting access to sensitive information.
